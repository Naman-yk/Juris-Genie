🔮 Future Scope

The future direction of this project focuses on transitioning the core reasoning layer from a purely LLM-driven, token-based approach to a deterministic, model-driven execution system.

We are actively working on integrating Concerto and Cicero (corresponding to the execution and validation stages of the architecture) to ensure that contract analysis is based on formally defined rules and mathematically verifiable outcomes, rather than probabilistic text generation.

In the evolved system, unstructured contract documents will first be interpreted only to the extent necessary to extract structure and intent. Once this structure is established, all downstream reasoning—including validation, risk evaluation, and outcome determination—will be handled by executable legal models instead of language predictions.

This shift enables the system to move beyond answering what a clause appears to mean and toward determining what the clause actually does, under explicitly defined rules and constraints.

The long-term goal is to produce deterministic, auditable, and reproducible legal outcomes, while reserving LLMs exclusively for tasks involving linguistic ambiguity, such as clause identification and normalization.
